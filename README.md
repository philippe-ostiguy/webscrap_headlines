# Access Historical Financial News Headlines with Python

Hi, I made an algorithm to get historical financial news with Python for free.

For the article with explanation, it's [here](https://ostiguyphilippe.medium.com/access-historical-financial-news-headlines-with-python-be1b8faaea9f).

Full documentation also available in this [file](https://github.com/philippe-ostiguy/webscrap_headlines/blob/master/web_scraping.py).

I hope this code will help for sentiment analysis of news headlines or for any other trading strategy.

Cheers!
